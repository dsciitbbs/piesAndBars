Following **TODO** items need to be handled: 
* Handle all TODO items inside code
* Add CSS to the site under static folder to revamp front-end
* Change homepage to have a form so that users can directly go to a graph they use to see and they don't have to type the URL manually. Something like the video shown <a href="https://github.com/metakgp/Kronos">here</a>
* Give more configuration options to charts, such as bar charts, line charts, scatter plot, pie charts etc. rather than only histograms.
* Collect missing data, such as for batch 15-16
* Currently, highest grade getter is shown on top as a *flash*. Change it to a more presentable option.
